							<p>At Oke Engineering, pllc, we find our meaning in life by helping you solve your “problems”.</p>
							<p>No, I’m nowhere near qualified enough to build you a rocket and shoot you into outer space.  But, we can find you a way to remove that load bearing wall between your kitchen and dining room.  We can find you a way to bump out your master bedroom so you can get that walk-in closet your clothes so desperately deserve.  We can find a way for you to build the house of your dreams or remodel your existing one into your new and improved home.  We can find a way to solve almost any residential structural, “problem,” and most importantly, we can find a way together.</p>
							<p>Being paid to fit a square peg into a round hole is what engineers do.</p>
